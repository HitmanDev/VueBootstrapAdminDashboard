Vue Material Dashboard is a beautiful resource built over Vue Material and Vuejs. It will help you get started developing dashboards in no time. Vue Material Dashboard is the official Vuejs version of the Original Material Dashboard. Using the Dashboard is pretty simple but requires basic knowledge of Javascript, Vuejs and Vue Router.

We have created it thinking about things you actually need in a dashboard. Vue Material Dashboard contains handpicked and optimised Vuejs plugins. Everything is designed to fit with one another. As you will be able to see, the dashboard you can access on Creative Tim is a customisation of this product.

Let us know what you think and what we can improve below. And good luck with development!
