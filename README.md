## Getting started
Vue Bootstrap Dashboard is built on top of Bootstrap 4, Vuejs . To get started do the following steps:

Download the project
Make sure you have node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
Type npm install in the source folder where package.json is located
Type npm run dev to start the development server
The repo uses vue-cli scaffolding which takes care of the development setup with webpack and all the necessary modern tools to make web development faster and easier.
